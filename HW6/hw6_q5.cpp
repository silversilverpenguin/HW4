/*
Write a program that reads a person’s name in the following format:
first name, then middle name or initial, and then last name.

The program then outputs the name in the following format:
Last_Name, First_Name Middle_Initial.

For example, the input
Mary Average User should produce the output:
User, Mary A.
The input Mary A. User should also produce the output:
User, Mary A.
Note that your program should work the same and place a period after the middle initial even if
the input did not contain a period.
Hint: You may want to use three string variables rather than one large string variable for the
input. You may find it easier to not use getline.
